# Trivia-night

Description
The team was assigned to work on our first collaborative project. We applied what we've learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application to showcase our web developing skills. Together we built a trivia game to test users' knowledge in specific areas or a wide range of topics and track their high scores.

User Story
AS a player
I WANT to answer trivia questions that are tracked by points
SO THAT I can obtain the high score

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I want to test my trivia knowledge WHEN I click on the select game options and press the play button THEN I am presented with a series of trivia questions under the category, difficulty level and game mode I chose WHEN I click on the correct answer THEN I gain points tracked by the score keeper WHEN prompted with a multiple choice question and the answer I select is correct THEN the answer turns green WHEN I click on the right choice THEN I gain an extra 5 seconds to answer additional questions WHEN the incorrect option is selected THEN that choice turns red and a sound effect is prompted.

Mock Up
When completed, the working code should present a home page with 3 dropdown menus (very fun categories, difficulty level and game mode) and a press to play button. A high score tracker is generated. The user will have the option to suggest custom questions that will be submitted under the 'custom' option under the Very Fun Categories menu. Once the prefered area of knowledge, level of difficulty, and timed/not timed options have been selected and the play button has been clicked on, then the user is brought to a second page that presents a series of questions based on the user preference.
